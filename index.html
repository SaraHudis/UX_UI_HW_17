        <p>Hello, my name is Sara Hudis. 

            I'm a content creator and designer specializing in writing, editing, and strategic media planning. My passions include drawing, animation, storytelling, traveling, and 3D printing. 
            
            Since graduating, I have worked as a Marketing Assistant at Readex Research and a Marketing Operations Specialist/Copywriter at Thomson Reuters.
            
            Currently, I am working towards an associate's degree in 3D Modeling and Animation while also finishing a UX/UI Boot Camp through the University of Minnesota.</p>
